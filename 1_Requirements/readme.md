# Requirements
# Introduction
   Blinking of LED is a simple project in Embedded progamming world. There are several ways of making a blinking LED circuit. You can make one using relays. You can        
   make one using transistors. Or you can make one using components like an inverter, a 555 Timer or a microcontroller. Here swtich is used to blink the two LED 
   using  ATmega328(a microcontroller).
# Objective
   The main objective is to blink the led using ATmega328 and a switch to controll two LED's.
# Features
   It has simple features.
       
    1.It can switch off the LED's when switch is in off state.
    2.It can switch on the LED's when switch is in on state.
